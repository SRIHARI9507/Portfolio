# Loan Approval Prediction System

This project predicts whether a loan will be approved or rejected using a machine learning model.

## Problem Statement
Banks need to evaluate loan applications based on customer financial details.
This project automates the loan approval decision using machine learning.

## Dataset
The dataset is created directly inside the Python code and includes:
- Income
- Loan Amount
- Credit Score
- Loan Status (Approved / Rejected)

## Algorithm Used
- Logistic Regression

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## How the Project Works
1. Data is loaded into a DataFrame
2. Features are split into training and testing sets
3. Data is scaled using StandardScaler
4. Logistic Regression model is trained
5. Model accuracy is calculated
6. User inputs values
7. Model predicts loan approval

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
 pip install pandas scikit-learn
2. Run the Python file:
 python loan_approval_ml.py
3. Enter values when prompted.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a simple end-to-end machine learning workflow for a real-world financial problem.
